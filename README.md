digital notebook / note taking
  A system of note taking that relies on old-fashioned concept cards, but easily editable
  and reading is done both linearly (one card after another) and branch-like (card 1 not
  only leads to card 2, but to other branches as well)
  
  Key components:
  + not mainly linear
  + cards are cross-referenced
  + "easily" editable
  + each card has two layers:
    1. structured, tagged, content with the edition capabilities of a common word processor
    2. unstructured playground on top, with free-hand drawing functionality

  Technical:
  - platform: desktop. doesn't really make sense as a web-app makes sense to port it to a
    tablet, but prototyping in python will be a lot faster than in Android
  - language: python. fast prototyping
  - GUI: wxpython. good community. past experience. portability
