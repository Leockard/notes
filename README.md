Digital notebook / note taking
A system of note taking that relies on old-fashioned concept cards, but easily editable
and reading is done both linearly (one card after another) and branch-like (card 1 not
only leads to card 2, but to other branches as well)
  
Key components:
+ not mainly linear
+ cards are cross-referenced
+ "easily" editable
+ each card has two layers:
  1. structured, tagged, content with the edition capabilities of a common word processor
  2. unstructured playground on top, with free-hand drawing functionality
